# Ancestry

The _ancestry_ QC module consists of a main script and three companion scripts.
It performs a PCA analysis (with or without reference populations) and generates
multiple ancestry plots.

Use the following command to access the multiple scripts of the _ancestry_ QC
module.

```shell-session
$ pyGenClean ancestry --help
usage: pyGenClean ancestry [-h] [-v]
                           {run,find-outliers,plot-mds,plot-eigenvalues} ...

Checks sample's ancestry using reference populations.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

subcommands:
  Below is a list of tools in the ancestry module. Note that 'run' executes
  the main ancestry pipeline.

  {run,find-outliers,plot-mds,plot-eigenvalues}
    run                 Checks sample's ancestry using reference populations.
    find-outliers       Finds outliers in SOURCE from CEU samples.
    plot-mds            Create an MDS plot.
    plot-eigenvalues    Plot eigenvalues (scree plot).
```

## Main script

The main script (access by using the `run` subcommand) performs a PCA analysis
of the source dataset (with or without reference populations).

### Input files

This module uses PLINKâ€™s binary file format (`bed`, `bim` and `fam` files) for
the source data set (the data of interest) and, optionally, three sets of binary
files for the reference panels (_CEU_, _YRI_ and _JPG-CHB_).

### Procedure

1. Finds the overlapping markers between the three reference panels and
   the source panel.
2. Extract the required markers from all the data sets.
3. Renames the reference panel's marker names to that they are the same as
   the source panel (for all populations).
4. Combines the three reference panels together.
5. Compute the frequency of all the markers from the reference and the
   source panels.
6. Finds the markers to flip in the reference panel (when compared to the
   source panel).
7. Excludes the unflippable markers from the reference and the source
   panels.
8. Flips the markers that need flipping in their reference panel.
9. Combines the reference and the source panels.
10. Runs part of the related samples QC module on the combined data set to
    generate the `genome` file.
11. Creates the `mds` file from the combined data set and the result of
    previous step.
12. Creates the population file.
13. Plots the `mds` values.
14. Finds the outliers of a given reference population's cluster.
15. If required, computes the Eigenvalues using `smartpca`.
16. If required, creates a scree plot from `smartpca` resutls.
